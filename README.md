Just some fun projects for family


## Getting started on RaspberryPI
from the terminal...
### Install git

> sudo apt-get install git
```

### Download repository
``` bash
> git clone https://github.com/rjarv/codecuz.git
> cd codecuz

## How to play rock, paper, scissors...

from the terminal
``` bash
> python ropasci.py rock
```
The above plays rock for Player 1 and scores this against a randomly generated computer choice. 
Of course, if you would like to play something other than rock, you can substitute that part of
the command for either scissors or paper and see how you stack up against the computer.

Enjoy! :)
